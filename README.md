<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Sentimental Mario (Less Comfortable)" problem set, implemented in Python. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/6/sentimental/mario/less/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>In this problem, I recreated the classic Mario pyramid-building program from Week 1, now using Python instead of C. This program takes a user input to specify the pyramid's height and then outputs a half-pyramid of hashes (`#`) of the specified height.</p> <p>This solution was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub complies with CS50’s academic honesty policy.

Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>User Input</strong>: Prompts the user to enter the height of the pyramid, accepting only valid integer inputs within the range (1–8).</li> <li><strong>Pyramid Construction</strong>: Uses loops to construct a half-pyramid of hashes (`#`), with the number of rows matching the specified height.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Prompts the user for a height input between 1 and 8 and validates the input.</li> <li><strong>Pyramid Printing</strong>: For each row, the program prints spaces to align the hashes, followed by a number of hashes corresponding to the row number.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not include any files provided by CS50, such as sample input-output files or additional resources.</p>
